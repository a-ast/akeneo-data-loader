# TO DO

## Docs

1. Add examples

## Code

1. Progress callback
1. Force to load fixtures in a specific order (e.g. attributes before products/models)
1. Bug: returns no exception if not auth
1. wrap exceptions to provide info which fixture failed
1. ETL?

## Ideas

1. Downloader from API to yaml files.
2. Converter for dictionaries: CSV to YAML (attribute options, reference records)
3. Pre-generator of fixtures (using empty yaml files as examples)
